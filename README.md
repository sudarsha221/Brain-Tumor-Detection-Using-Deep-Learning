# Brain-Tumor-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning
# AIM
The main aim of the brain tumor detection project is to develop an automated system using deep learning 
that accurately detects brain tumors from MRI images.
 It assists doctors in early diagnosis, reduces human error, improves diagnostic speed, 
and supports better clinical decision-making for effective treatment planning.
# objective
To build a brain tumor detection model using deep learning.
To pre-process the MRI images by removing unwanted data and resizing.
To use the VGG16 model for model training and classification.
To evaluate the performance of the proposed model by various performance metrics.
To create an interface where users can upload an MRI image and get the prediction result.
